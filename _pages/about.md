My research interest centers on designing and controlling novel robotic systems.

I am a Postdoc at UC San Diego working with [Xiaolong Wang](https://xiaolonw.github.io/index.html) and [Mike Tolley](https://tolley.eng.ucsd.edu/), exploring data-driven approaches for soft robot design. I completed my PhD from the [Robotics Institute](http://ri.cmu.edu) at Carnegie Mellon University coadvised by [Katia Sycara](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/) and [Zeynep Temel](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/zeynep-temel/). My research is supported by the CMU Presidential Fellowship (2020 - 2021). Prior to this, I received my MS degree from the same department with [Katia Sycara](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sycara/). I completed my BEng in Electronics and Information Engineering at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. I also spent time at Amazon Robotics, Microsoft, and a couple of startups.
